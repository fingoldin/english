			<h1>Women's Healthcare Under the Taliban As Displayed in <i>A Thousand Splendid Suns</i></h1>

					In <i>A Thousand Splendid Suns</i> by Khaled Hosseini the two female protagonists Laila and Mariam struggle with the accessibility to proper health care under the Taliban's regime.
					In the months leading up to the birth of Laila's son, the Taliban ban women from going to men's hospitals as part of their reforms.
					<br><br>
					As Hosseini states through the voice of a female doctor during Laila's stay at the women's hospital, 
					"'You think I want it this way?' she said. 'What do you want me to do? They won't give me what I need. I have no X-ray either, no suction, no oxygen, not even simple antibiotics. When NGOs offer money, the Taliban turn them away. Or they funnel the money to the places that cater to men'" (290). 
					The Taliban were not only segregating women's health care from men's, they were not giving any important resources to these hospitals, clearly voicing that to them women's health didn't matter. 
					To them, their money and resources are much better spent on men.
					<br><br>
					While enforcing these rules, the Taliban was violent and harsh, as shown by violence of the Taliban officials outside a men's hospital. 
					Hosseini writes, "The Talib lifted his Kalashnikov and fired rounds into the air. Another Talib behind him brandished a whip. The crowd dispersed quickly" (286). 
					The Taliban are so strict about their segregation of medical facilities that they are willing to threaten people just looking for medical treatment for themselves and their loved ones with machine guns and death. 
					<br><br>
					Laila and her baby's life are in danger, and the refusal of men to help her and provide the hospitals that will create a dangerous society where women are dying in ways that could have easily been prevented in years past. 
					The Taliban's total and absolute control of a woman's health creates an environment where a woman's life is worth nothing, the values of a misogynist organization negatively affecting Laila, Mariam, and every other woman's life in Afghanistan.
