			<h1>The Stigma Around Microcephaly and Zika</h1>
		</div>
		<div class="element-load main-article">
			<div class="main-article-text">
				<p>
					Microcephaly, an affliction where a baby is born with a smaller than average brain, has recently exploded in number of cases in Brazil. 
					The cause of this epidemic has been linked to the Zika virus, transmitted by the <i>Aedes</i> aegypti mosquito, and the Brazilian government has begun a war against these mosquitoes. 
					However, children born with this affliction are often mistreated because of their physical appearance. 
					For example, many mothers recount stories of strangers asking them intrusive or interrogatory questions about their child, pulling their own children away in fear of 'contagion', or sniffing or rubbing, without consent from the parent, the child's head (Jinyi Li). 
					<br><br>
					In December of 2015, a group of 6 mothers in Recife, Brazil, created a group named the 'Union of Mothers of Angels' to combat this prejudice. Since its creation, the group has grown to include several dozen familes.
					They lead walks and protests against the injustice they and their children face because of their children's condition, holding banners with message such as "Microcephaly is not the end" and "Our children don't need your pity, they need your respect" (Jinyi Li).

				<p>
					Since not much is known about raising children with microcephaly yet, members of UMA help each other with raising their children despite their affliction.
					In addition, they provide moral support for each other, since "the single mothers often don't have any one to defend them when they face discrimination in the streets or the health clinics", says Marcilo Marroquin Santiago, who is currently dating a mother of a child with microcephaly (Jinyi Li).
					The president of UMA, Germana Soares, described how "the neighborhood nurses refuse to vaccinate our babies, telling us to go to the rehabilitation center for special needs children" (Jinyi Li).
				</p>
				<h5 class="stat">
					In May, Pernambuco registered over nine thousand cases of <i>Aedes</i> aegypti transmitted diseases within one week (Jinyi Li).

					These women contract Zika from living in poverty, and yet they have no power, nor method to escape.
					This results in a generation of special needs children, children who need to most resources to live and yet are given the least because of the stigma they face as a result of their physical appearance.
					Through groups such as UMA, it is possible for this stigma to change. But it takes a lot of effort to overcome people's views. If you would like to get involved, check out UMA's <a href="https://www.facebook.com/uniaodemaesdeanjos/">Facebook page</a>.
