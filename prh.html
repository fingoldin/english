					The Physicians for Reproductive Health is an organization dedicated to improving access to reproductive health care, such as contraception and abortion, and to helping those who are economically impoverished get access to resources enabling them to make their own decisions about their reproductive health. 
					According to <a href="http://prh.org/about">their website</a>, in order to achieve their goals they introduce legislation and medical practices, train doctors in best practices, advocate for reproductive health as a core part of medecine, and offer their resources to physicians around the world. 
					They have a perfect 100.00 score for both financial practices and transparency on charitynavigator.org, and spend 85.8 % of their expenses on programs and achieving their goals, with only 6.8 % spent on administration ("Rating for PRH"). They often work with medical and women's health organizations to improve health conditions in places all over the world, and they believe in reproductive choice for everyone. 
					<br><br>
					One of their most important issues is fighting for access to abortion resources and clinics, and removing the stigma that surrounds abortion today. 
					By contributing to a charity such as Physicians for Reproductive Health, you can advance the movement to provide legal abortion for all. 
					In addition, abortion is a critical issue in the Zika epidemic, as pregnant women face up to 3 years in prison for abortion in Brazil, whether their baby has microcephaly or not. 
					Those women who choose to end their pregnancy because of a disease such as Zika must do so illegally, which has extremely serious physical, emotional, and legal consequences. 
					If we all show our support of this issue through nonprofits and charities such as PRH, a change will quickly come around. 
					If you would like to contribute to PRH, head over to their <a href="http://prh.org">website</a>.
