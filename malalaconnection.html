					Often, in less developed countries, or those with ineffective governments, basic public services such as clean water supply and waste collection become a rarity, especially in rural areas. 
					In <i>I Am Malala</i>, by Malala Yousafzai, the narrator, Malala, experiences this absence of basic services in her home province of Pakistan, Swat. 
					She writes, "Just along the street from our new house was an abandoned strip of land that people used as a rubbish dump-there is no rubbish collection in Swat. Quickly, it became a rubbish mountain" (Malala, 80). 
					With the government not bothering to remove waste and lacking the necessary resources to do it themselves, the resident of Malala's town, Mingora, are left with no choice but to dump all their rotting food and unwanted items in one big pile, alarmingly close to their own homes. 
					<br><br>
					On an errand to throw away some egg shells, Malala describes,  "as I threw the rubbish on the mountain of rotting food, I saw something move and I jumped. It was a girl about my age. Her hair was matted and her skin was covered in sores" (Malala, 81). 
					The lack of opportunity for orphaned children demonstrated in this quote is devastating. 
					The girl that Malala sees sorting garbage has no choice but to work in such a degrading situation in order to survive. 
					By spending her days sorting through a large pile of rotting organic material, she is exposed to countless diseases, such as tuberculosis, anthrax, and trichinosis. 
					In fact, it is clear that some disease has already taken hold of her, evident by the sores covering her skin. 
					In addition, when Malala asks her father about the scavenger girl, he responds saying that "the children would sell what they had sorted to a garbage shop for a few rupees", implying that the existence of such children is common knowledge and therefore not a very rare situation to be in. 
					But the scavenger girl does not have any chance to escape from these squalid conditions, for if the Pakistani government is constantly passing power from one military dictator to another, how can it be bothered with helping orphans?
