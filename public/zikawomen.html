			<h1>The Zika Outbreak in Brazil</h1>

				<p>
					In February of 2016 the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the Zika virus in Central and South America a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. 
					While this virus had been present in Africa and other parts of the world, this outbreak in the Americas created a huge problem. "The epidemic is probably at least more than halfway through in Brazil," said Neil Ferguson, director of the MRC Centre for Outbreak Analysis and Modelling, School of Public Health at Imperial College London (Szabo). While the symptoms of Zika for most individuals are mild and non life threatening, including fever, headaches, joint pain, and rashes, for pregnant women or women planning on becoming pregnant there are extreme risks (cdc.gov). 
					The CDC has confirmed that Zika virus in pregnant women can lead to microcephaly, a birth defect where the baby's head is smaller than normal. 
					Zika virus can also lead to other birth defects including vision and hearing problems, and impaired growth.
				</p>
				<h5 class="stat">
					As of July 2016, some 93.4 million people are were at risk of getting infected with Zika in Latin America and the Caribbean alone, of which some 1.7 million are childbearing women ("Statistics and facts about Zika").
				</h5>
				<p>
					The women who are at higher risk for Zika are poor, living in less sanitary conditions without the resources and abilities to prevent infection. It is not practical to expect these women to not get bitten, and it is not practical to expect these women to prevent pregnancy with no access to resources to help them make educated decisions (Debora Diniz). 
					These women, and all women in Brazil and most other countries affected, are not given the right to chose about their pregnancies. 
					Brazil has some of the strictest policies in the world, only allowing abortion when the woman's life is in danger, the fetus is a product of rape, or the fetus is anencephalic, meaning that it would be born without parts of its brain or skull. 
					This lack of access to abortion leads to illegal abortions, which can have dire consequences for the mothers, both physically and emotionally. 
				</p>
				<h5 class="stat">
					Brazilian health officials have confirmed more than 1,600 cases of microcephaly since the Zika outbreak began, about 10 times more than usual (Szabo).
				</h5>
				<p>
					The difficulty women have finding and receiving resources that make it possible to prevent Zika virus in South and Central America revolve around pregnancy and lack of education. 
					Impoverished women are not allowed to control their reproductive rights because of the political and societal environment in which they live. 
					The superficial problem is the outbreak of Zika, but the underlying issue is the fact that women aren't given the resources with which to make the best decision about their bodies and their futures. 
					This problem needs to change.
