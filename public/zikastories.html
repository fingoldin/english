					The video Zika, the film directed by Debora Diniz explores the life of several women in Brazil who have been affected by the Zika virus. 
					One story highlighted in the film was of a woman name Gessica Dos Santos, whose deceased son was affected by the Zika virus and died due to complications with the virus. 
					Gessica tells her story, one that seems all too common within these communities, as similar features appear again and again. 
					She was 20 weeks pregnant when she found out that her baby was affected by a particularly severe case of microcephaly. 
					<br><br>
					After extensive testing, she and her husband decided to continue with pregnancy, understanding the likelihood of death after the child was born. 
					5 months after finding out that she was affected by the Zika virus, she delivered her child through a caesarian section, and the baby's health required it be taken immediately to the intensive care unit. 
					The following day Gessica visited her son in the intensive care unit, and shortly after returning to her room she was notified that he had died. 
					<br><br>
					Of the experience following the death of her child Gessica says, "I asked to hold him, and they put him in my arms and I kissed him, I held him, I sang him lullabies, I did everything I wanted, everything a mother wants to do with her baby and the moment between mother and child, even if he wasn't alive anymore". 
					Gessica allowed her baby's body to be used for science, saying that "if it was his mission to come and undergo this then I give you that permission".
					Gessica, and the many other women in the video all dealt with the changes that Zika had in their life, while still dealing with poverty and other very difficult issues. 
					These women show the worst side of the virus, one filled with tragedy and heartbreak, but at the same time, women like Gessica who are willing to sacrifice anything for their children, allow for a sense of hope underneath the awfulness that Zika leads to.
